Our first project under Robotix club of IIT Hyderabad

We can learn if the user is sitting, walking, standing still or running using this system. 

Used Genuino 101 to train the data and predict the output.
Made an app for android which connects with BLE module in Genuino 101 and gets the data in your smart phone.
This app then sends the data to our firebase real-time database which stores the activity for whole day of the user.

It then displays the activities in the app done by the user for whole day.
